E-Commerce Single Page Application
----------------------------------

### Goal
Build a mobile-optimized app that shows our catalog of products. You can use any JS framework or vanilla JS, that's up to you.
All the data you will need is available in `./catalog.json`. There is no need to make external API calls.

### Product Listing
List all products with infinite scroll pagination. The cart icon can be just a counter of products in the cart.

### Product Detail
Clicking on a product card should reveal product description and specs. The specs section should be collapsible.
Favoriting a product in this view (heart icon) should reflect in the product listing view.
Adding 1+ products to cart should reflect in the cart icon in the product listing view.

### Design guide
Please use the following Figma mock to guide your implementation:\

A .fig and .pdf file are also available in the `mocks` folder.

This font import can be used to load the fonts referenced in the mock:\
