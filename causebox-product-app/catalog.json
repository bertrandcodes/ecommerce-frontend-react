The children most likely to fall behind in school were ones being raised by single mothers who did not have many economic opportunities. Imani Collective was founded to help provide employment opportunities to these women, not only helping lift them out of poverty but supporting their children and generations to come. Artisans are paid fairly and consistently, with wages that are over 2.5x the minimum wage. Their materials are sourced locally in Kenya to reduce environmental impact.</p>",

Each of their products are ethically made using only recycled or sustainable materials, and give back to protect our wildlife and the land they call home through Big Life Africa.</p>\n<p>The Wet Swim Pouch included in our 2019 Summer Box is just the same — made from a recycled polyester fabric, woven from yarn created by breaking down plastic bottles into plastic chips that are converted into a strong fiber. We love what this brand is doing to transform single-use products into something beautiful and functional, fighting for ethical practices and the protection of our natural spaces!</p>",
